title: Using the Development UI
---

Quirrel features an easy-to-use development UI that can be used to monitor and manage pending jobs during development.

<img src={require("./dev-ui.png").default} alt="Screenshot of the Development UI" height="600rem"/>

To use it, just open [ui.quirrel.dev](https://ui.quirrel.dev).
It runs fully client-side and works by connecting to `localhost:9181` (the Quirrel port).
